Requirements for the program
----------------------------

! Important !
Due to personal time constraint I have not finished working on this project. As stated in the description of this task:
"Note: due to potentially needing to wait for the pair-programming sessions, you can work on this project in parallel 
to the main project. In extreme cases, you may even continue and complete this part after you have passed this sprintâ€™s 
corrections."
I will finish this task as soon as I have committed the main project of this sprint.
Sorry! But there are serious objective reasons for this delay.

As a compensation, this program will be a little bit more interesting than the requirements of this task prescribe. (As
you can see in the description below. :)
